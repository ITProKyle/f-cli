Documentation
=============

Documentation is created using the source in ``docs/``. It is automatically built and hosted on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ when an update is made to the **master branch** or a new tagged release is created.


Build Docs Locally
------------------

The docs can be built locally in the ``docs/`` directory by running ``make html`` in ``docs/``. The HTML output is places in ``docs/build/``.
